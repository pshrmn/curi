      <p>
        When a user navigates to one of your routes, the re-rendering will not
        be triggered until a response has been created. If the route that
        matches has a <IJS>match.every</IJS> function that has to make a request
        to the server, the re-render will be delayed, possibly giving the user
        the impression that nothing is happening. One way that you can attempt
        to show that something is happening is by adding a loading bar to your
        page that will demonstrate to the user that their request is going
        through.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <IJS>nprogress</IJS> package allows you to render a loading bar that
        will run across the top of your page. There are many possible solutions,
        but this one is very easy to use, so it works well for our example. The
        basis of what we will do is to tell <IJS>nprogress</IJS> to start when
        the user clicks a link, and then when we re-render, we tell{" "}
        <IJS>nprogress</IJS> that we are done loading.
      </p>

      <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
        {`// when the user clicks a <Link>
nprogress.start();
// when we are re-rendering
nprogress.done();
`}
      </PrismBlock>

      <p>
        The example implementation can definitely be improved. Currently we are
        calling <IJS>nprogress.done()</IJS> as a side effect of our render
        function. This is not ideal, but again, this is just a minimum viable
        example. In your own application, you could add a response handler or
        use a Curi side effect.
