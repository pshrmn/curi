        Server rendering with Curi is fairly straightforward. You should have a
        catch all route handler that will respond to all (non-static file)
        requests.
      </p>

      <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
        {`function catchAll(req, res) {
  // 1. Create a memory history using the requested location
  const history = InMemory({ locations: [req.url]});

  // 2. Create a router
  const router = curi(history, routes);

  // 3. Wait for the response to be generated
  router.respond(({ response, navigation }) => {
    // 4. Generate the HTML markup by rendering a <CuriProvider> and
    // passing it the router.
    const markup = renderToString(
      <CuriProvider router={router}>
        {renderFunction}
      </CuriProvider>
    );
    // 5. Insert the markup into the page's html and send it
    res.send(renderFullPage(markup));
  }, { once: true });
}`}

        The above example is very basic. Some other things that you might need
        to consider are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Data loading — You would need to maintain two copies of your routes if
          you want to handle data fetching on the server differently than it
          works on the client side. This is not something that I have explored
          very closely yet, so I don't have any recommendations on exactly how
          to approach this.
        </li>
        <li>
          Code splitting — In order to use dynamic imports on the server, you
          will probably need to use a Babel plugin like{" "}
          <IJS>dynamic-import-node</IJS>. Unfortunately,{" "}
          <IJS>dynamic-import-node</IJS> breaks Webpack's code splitting. In
          order for your code to be split into multiple bundles, you should
          ensure that <IJS>dynamic-import-node</IJS> isn't being run when
          building your client side bundle. The solution used in this experiment
          is to use the <IJS>env</IJS> property.
          <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
            {`{
  "presets": [ "es2015", "react" ],
  "plugins": [
    "syntax-dynamic-import"
  ],
  "env": {
    "server": {
      "plugins": ["dynamic-import-node"]
    }
  }
}`}
          </PrismBlock>
          Then, when starting the server, make sure that BABEL_ENV=server.
          <PrismBlock lang="markup">
            {`cross-env BABEL_ENV=server npm start`}
          </PrismBlock>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </Section>
