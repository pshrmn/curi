    <p>
      Curi side effects are essentially permament subscribers (response
      handlers) to your router. They can be considered slightly more convenient
      than response handlers since you don't have to subscribe to your router to
      set them up. However, you also cannot remove them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whenever a new response is generated, all of the side effect functions
      will be called. They will be given two arguments: the new response object
      and an object with navigation information (the navigation action the
      previous response).
    </p>

    <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
      {`function logResponse({ response }) {
  // call your logging API to record the response
}`}
    </PrismBlock>

    <Section title="Adding Side Effects" id="adding">
      <p>
        You add side effect functions to your router by adding a{" "}
        <IJS>sideEffects</IJS> array to the options object (the third agument)
        of <IJS>curi</IJS>. A side effect is an object with an <IJS>fn</IJS>{" "}
        property whose values is a response handler function.
      </p>

      <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
        {`const router = curi(history, routes, {
  sideEffects: [{ fn: logResponse }]
});`}
      </PrismBlock>

      <p>
        Side effects can also have an <IJS>after</IJS> property. By default,
        side effect functions will be called before any response handler
        functions (the ones added with <IJS>router.respond</IJS>). However, you
        might prefer for a side effect to be run after the response handlers. To
        do that, you just need to include <IJS>after: true</IJS> in your side
        effect object. If you do no provide this property, this will default to{" "}
        <IJS>false</IJS>.
      </p>

      <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
        {`const router = curi(history, routes, {
  sideEffects: [{ fn: logResponse, after: true }]
});`}
      </PrismBlock>

      <Subsection title="Official Side Effects" id="official">
        <p>Curi has two "official" side effect packages:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <Link to="Package" params={{ package: "side-effect-title" }}>
              @curi/side-effect-title
            </Link>
          </li>
          <li>

    <Section title="Creating Side Effects" id="creating">
      <p>
        Side effects are just simple functions that receive a response object
        and a navigation object and do something with them. One thing that they
        should not do, however, is to modify the response.
      </p>

      <p>
        Below is a side effect function that sets a modified property on the
        object.
      </p>
      <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
        {`function mySideEffect({ response, navigation }) {
  console.log('Navigating to', response.location);
  console.log('Navigation action:', navigation.action);
}

const router = curi(history, routes, {
  sideEffects: [{ fn: mySideEffect }]
});`}
      </PrismBlock>

      <p>
        You can write a side effect factory if you need to create a more
        customizable side effect.
      </p>

      <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
        {`function AnalyticsLogger(options) {
  // do some setup with the provided options
  const logger = setupMyLogger(options);

  // and return the actual side effect function
  return sideEffect({ response }) {
    logger(response);
  }
}`}
      </PrismBlock>

      <p>
        That really is all there is required to know in order to write your own
        side effects. You may want to review the{" "}
        <Link to="Guide" params={{ slug: "responses" }}>
          response
        </Link>{" "}
        properties to know which properties you should expect a response to
        have, but other than that they are pretty simple.
      </p>

      <p>
        <IJS>curi</IJS>'s options object has three arguments. We have covered
        the first two, so finally we will cover the cache option in the{" "}
