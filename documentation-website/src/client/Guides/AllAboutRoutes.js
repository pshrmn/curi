      Routes are simply JavaScript objects with two required props: name and
      path. There are also a number of other props that you can use to enhance
      the routes. We will cover these below.
    </p>

    <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
      {`{
  name: 'Home',
  path: ''
};`}

    <Section title="Matching Routes" id="matching-routes">
      <p>
        First, we should cover how route matching works. Curi takes an array of
        route objects. Whenever Curi receives a new location, it will walk over
        the route objects in the order that they are defined in the array.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes a route's path with only partially match the location's
        pathname. When this happens, the matching behavior will vary based on
        the route's props. By default, routes perform exact matching. This means
        that when the route only matches part of the pathname, it does not count
        as a match.
      </p>
      <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
        {`// when the pathname is '/a/Run+The+Jewels+3/Hey+Kids',
// the Album route will partially match the pathname. However,
// Curi looks for complete matches, so it will move on to the
// next route
{
  name: 'Album',
  path: 'a/:album'
}`}
      </PrismBlock>
      <p>
        However, if the route has children, then Curi will check if any of those
        routes form a complete match before moving on to the next route in the
        routes array.
      </p>
      <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
        {`// when the pathname is '/a/Coloring+Book/All+Night',
// the Album route will partially match the pathname. Then,
// its child route Song will be tested and fully match the pathname.
{
  name: 'Album',
  path: 'a/:album',
  children: [
    {
      name: 'Song',
      path: ':title'
    }
  ]
}`}
      </PrismBlock>
      <p>
        Another possibility happens when you use the <IJS>pathOptions</IJS>{" "}
        object to set <IJS>end: false</IJS>. When you do that, then a route the
        partially matches will consider itself matched.
      </p>
      <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
        {`// when the pathname is '/a/Good+Kid,+M.A.A.D+City/Poetic+Justice',
// the Album route will partially match. However, because it sets
// end to false, the partial match will be used.
{
  name: 'Album',
  path: 'a/:albumID',
  pathOptions: {
    end: false
  }
}`}
      </PrismBlock>
      <p>
        If none of your routes match a pathname, then Curi will set a "404"
        status on the response object. The <IJS>body</IJS> property of the
        response will also be <IJS>undefined</IJS>, so it is important that your
        application checks the response's status when it goes to render a
        response. You can also add a wildcard route (<IJS>path: '(.*)'</IJS>) to
        the end of your routes array, and that route will always match. You may
        want to still manually set the status to "404" for the wildcard route,
        but it is not required.

        <Note>
          While path-to-regexp supports arrays and RegExps, only string paths

          While not required (like the <IJS>name</IJS> and <IJS>path</IJS>{" "}

            route to display properly. For example, if you are doing code
            splitting with Webpack using <IJS>import()</IJS>, you would load the

                application receives a redirect response, it should redirect to
                the new location (using your history object) instead of
                re-rendering. If you do not provide a code, then 301 will be
                used. Setting the status code is mostly important for rendering
