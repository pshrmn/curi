      The Curi router is somewhat similar to React Router versions 2 and 3, so
      migration is fairly easy. For instance, both use a centralized router.
      Both routers are made up of route objects (although with React Router some
      of these are disguised as JSX with <Cmp>Route</Cmp> components). With
      both, routes can be nested, allowing child routes to build off of the
      paths from their parent routes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Migration from React Router v2/3 to Curi should not require a complete
      reworking of your application, but there are some key differences.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The routing is handled entirely outside of React. With Curi, there are
        no <Cmp>Route</Cmp> components.
      </li>
      <li>
        With Curi, when a nested route matches, only that route renders. Any
        ancestor routes that also (partially) match are not rendered. This is
        different from React Router, where ancestors of the best matched route
        also render.
      </li>
    </ol>

      <p>Let’s get started with setting up our routes.</p>

      <Subsection title="With React Router" id="routes-with-react-router">
        <p>
          In React Router v2/3, there are two ways to define routes. You can
          either use JavaScript objects or JSX <Cmp>Route</Cmp>s (which React
          Router converts to JavaScript objects).
        </p>
        <PrismBlock lang="jsx">
          {`// JavaScript objects
{
  path: '/',
  component: App,
  indexRoute: Home,
  childRoutes: [
    {
      path: 'inbox',
      component: Inbox,
      childRoutes: [
        {
          path: ':message',
          component: Message,
          onEnter: (next) => {...},
          onChange: (prev, next) => {...},
          onLeave: (prev) => {...}
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
// JSX
<Route path='/' component={App}>
  <IndexRoute component={Home} />
  <Route path='inbox' component={Inbox}>
    <Route
      path=':message'
      component={Message}
      onEnter={next => {...}}
      onChange={(prev, next) => {...}}
      onLeave={prev => {...}}
    />
  </Route>
</Route>`}
        </PrismBlock>
        <p>
          Both styles described above define the same route structure for three
          routes: <IJS>/</IJS>, <IJS>/inbox</IJS>, and{" "}
          <IJS>/inbox/:message</IJS>. Each one of these has a component that
          will be rendered when it matches. The <IJS>/inbox/:message</IJS> route
          has some methods defined to describe its behavior when the route
          enters, updates, and leaves.
        </p>
      </Subsection>
      <Subsection title="With Curi" id="routes-with-curi">
        <p>
          Routes in Curi are always JavaScript objects. Like React Router, each
          route object has a path property that describes the path segments that
          the route matches. React Router v2/3 uses a custom path matcher, but
          Curi uses <IJS>path-to-regexp</IJS>. You can read learn how to format
          paths from the{" "}
          <a href="https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp">
            <IJS>path-to-regexp</IJS> repo
          </a>.
        </p>

        <p>First, we will just define the paths for our routes.</p>
        <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
          {`const routes = [
  {
    path: ''
  },
  {
    path: 'inbox',
    children: [
      {
        path: ':message'
      }
    ]
  }
];`}
        </PrismBlock>

        <p>
          The biggest difference between the Curi paths and the React Router
          paths is that with Curi, you never include a forward slash at the
          beginning of the path. This means that while the root path for React
          Router is <IJS>'/'</IJS>, the root path for Curi is <IJS>''</IJS>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we should add our components to each route. We will ignore the{" "}
          <Cmp>App</Cmp> component that is used in the React Router routes. That
          is not route specific and will be rendered by our application
          (assuming we actually need it).
        </p>
        <p>
          With Curi routes, we have a <IJS>match</IJS> property. This is an
          object with a couple different optional function properties, but the
          one we care about right now is <IJS>match.response</IJS>. In our{" "}
          <IJS>match.response</IJS> function, we have a <IJS>set</IJS> object
          that we can use to modify the response. One of the properties of this
          object is a <IJS>body</IJS> function that we can call to set the{" "}
          <IJS>body</IJS> property of the response. For this React application,
          we want our <IJS>body</IJS> property to be the React component
          associated with each route.
        </p>

        <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
          {`const routes = [
  {
    path: '',
    match: {
      response: ({ set }) => {
        set.body(Home);
      }
    }
  },
  {
    path: 'inbox',
    match: {
      response: ({ set }) => {
        set.body(Inbox);
      }
    }
    children: [
      {
        path: ':message',
        match: {
          response: ({ set }) => {
            set.body(Message);
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
];`}
        </PrismBlock>
        <p>
          We are close to replicating our React Router routes, we just have to
          implement the <IJS>on___</IJS> methods for our <IJS>:message</IJS>{" "}
          route. With Curi, routes have two possible loading function
          properties: <IJS>match.initial</IJS> and <IJS>match.every</IJS>.{" "}
          <IJS>match.initial</IJS> is useful for tasks that only need to be run
          once per route, like the code splitting mentioned above.{" "}
          <IJS>match.every</IJS>, on the other hand, will be called every time
          that a route matches.
        </p>
        <p>
          With React Router, <IJS>onEnter</IJS> is called when the route first
          matches, while <IJS>onChange</IJS> is called when the same route
          matches a new location (e.g. with new path parameters).{" "}
          <IJS>onEnter</IJS> and <IJS>onChange</IJS> are nearly the same; the
          big difference between the two is that <IJS>onChange</IJS> will
          receive the previous props, which could be used to determine which
          props changed. When converting these to Curi, we will use{" "}
          <IJS>match.every</IJS> for both. This misses out on the ability to
          compare props in <IJS>onChange</IJS>, but the primary purpose for
          comparing props in <IJS>onChange</IJS> was to know whether you're
          navigating to a new route or just swapping query/hash values, so a
          cache should serve the same purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Curi routes can also have a <IJS>match.response</IJS> property which
          you can use to modify the response object. This function will run once
          we know that the response will be emitted, so side effects can be run
          in here.
        </p>
        <p>
          There currently is no equivalent to <IJS>onLeave</IJS> with Curi. This
          is mostly because I haven’t seen a compelling need for it. It
          certainly could be implemented, but so far I have not found a reason
          to use that. If you have something you need this functionality for,
          please open up an issue in the GitHub repo.

          Curi uses route names to allow you to interact with routes. For
          example, you can navigate to the “Inbox” route just by knowing its
          name instead of its URI. This can be especially handy when dealing
          with complicated pathnames or if you need to change the URI structure
          of your website. With Curi, you never have to write a URI yourself!
        </p>
      </Subsection>
      <p>
        Once your routes have been defined, you can move on to creating your
        Curi router.
      </p>
    </Section>

    <Section title="Creating the router" id="creating-the-router">
      <p>
        With React Router, you create your router by rendering a{" "}
        <Cmp>Router</Cmp>. That either takes the <Cmp>Route</Cmp> components as
        props or the route objects through its <IJS>routes</IJS> prop. The{" "}
        <Cmp>Router</Cmp> also takes a <IJS>history</IJS> prop, which is either
        one of the pre-routerured objects (<IJS>browserHistory</IJS> or{" "}
        <IJS>hashHistory</IJS>) or one that you create yourself.
      </p>
      <PrismBlock lang="jsx">
        {`import { Router, browserHistory } from 'react-router';
const routes = [...];
ReactDOM.render((
  <Router history={browserHistory} routes={routes} />
), holder);`}
      </PrismBlock>
      <p>
        With Curi, the router is created prior to rendering. It takes a Hickory
        history object, your routes array, and possibly an options object. <a href="https://github.com/pshrmn/hickory">
          Hickory
        </a>{" "}
        is similar to the <IJS>history</IJS> package used by React Router, but
        has a slight modified API (easier navigation blocking and navigation
        that imitates how anchors work) and more convenient location objects
        (you can use a <IJS>query</IJS> object instead of having to manually
        create a <IJS>search</IJS> string).
      </p>
      <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
        {`import curi from '@curi/core';
import Browser from '@hickory/browser';
const history = Browser();
const routes = [...];
const router = curi(history, routes);`}
      </PrismBlock>
    </Section>

    <Section title="Rendering" id="rendering">
      <p>
        At this point, our Curi router isn’t actually quite ready to render.
        Curi creates response objects asynchronously, so if we render right
        away, we might not have a response object to render with. We can work
        around this by rendering nothing (<IJS>null</IJS>) at first, but instead
        we should usually just wait for our initial response to be ready.
      </p>
      <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
        {`router.respond(({ response }) => {
  // now our first response has resolved, so we
  // know that we will render with an actual response
});`}
      </PrismBlock>
      <p>
        We will walk through the rendering differences between React Router and
        Curi by looking at what happens in each when we navigate to the URI{" "}
        <IJS>/inbox/test-message-please-ignore</IJS>.
      </p>
      <Subsection title="React Router v2/3" id="rendering-react-router">
        <p>
          React Router uses the <Cmp>Router</Cmp> component to subscribe to
          location changes. Each time that the location changes, it walks over
          its routes and determines which route(s!) match.
        </p>
        <p>
          React Router starts by rendering the root component. In the above
          router, that is the <Cmp>App</Cmp>. Next, our <IJS>inbox</IJS> route
          also matches, so React Router also renders our <Cmp>Inbox</Cmp>{" "}
          component. Finally, the URI{" "}
          <IJS>/inbox/test-message-please-ignore</IJS> also matches our <IJS>
            :message
          </IJS>{" "}
          route (which is concatenated with its parents to form the path{" "}
          <IJS>/inbox/:message</IJS>), so <Cmp>Message</Cmp> is rendered as
          well. Each child component is rendered by its parent, so we end up
          with a component tree that looks something like this:
        </p>
        <PrismBlock lang="jsx">
          {`<App>
  <Inbox>
    <Message>
  </Inbox>
</App>`}
        </PrismBlock>
        <p>
          With this structure, any routes with children will be rendered when
          one of the children matches. That means that those routes need to know
          how to render based on what type of match they have. For example,{" "}
          <Cmp>Inbox</Cmp> needs to know how to render for an exact match (the
          URI is <IJS>/inbox</IJS>) and for a partial match (<IJS>
            /inbox/test-message-please-ignore
          </IJS>). Also, if the <Cmp>Inbox</Cmp> needs to pass any props to{" "}
          <Cmp>Message</Cmp>, it has to use <IJS>React.cloneElement</IJS>, which
          works but is not the cleanest looking code.
        </p>
      </Subsection>
      <Subsection title="Curi" id="rendering-with-curi">
        <p>
          With Curi, we also need to re-render our application every time that
          the location changes. We will do this using the{" "}
          <Cmp>CuriProvider</Cmp> component, which comes from the{" "}
          <IJS>@curi/react</IJS> package.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <Cmp>CuriProvider</Cmp> takes a <IJS>router</IJS> prop, which it
          will use to listen for the router to emit new responses (by internally
          calling <IJS>router.respond</IJS>) The <Cmp>CuriProvider</Cmp> places
          the new <IJS>response</IJS> and <IJS>navigation</IJS> (alongside the{" "}
          <IJS>router</IJS> object) on React's <IJS>context</IJS> so that child
          components will be able to access those values.{" "}
          <Cmp>CuriProvider</Cmp> also expects a render function as its{" "}
          <IJS>children</IJS> prop.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will also use <IJS>router.respond</IJS> to wait for the initial
          response to be emitted before rendering.
        </p>
        <PrismBlock lang="jsx">
          {`router.respond(() => {
  ReactDOM.render((
    <CuriProvider router={router}>
      {({ response }) => {...}}
    </CuriProvider>
  ), holder);
});`}
        </PrismBlock>
        <p>
          So what should your render function look like? The render function
          will receive an object with three properties: <IJS>response</IJS>, the
          new response object, <IJS>navigation</IJS>, an object with additional
          information about the navigation, and <IJS>router</IJS>, your Curi
          router. We will ignore the <IJS>navigation</IJS> and <IJS>router</IJS>{" "}
          here because the <IJS>response</IJS> is what we really want.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier, we added <IJS>body</IJS> properties to each of the routes and
          said that when a route matches, that function would be called and its
          return value would be attached to the response. That means, that
          inside of our render function, we can access the matched route’s
          component as <IJS>response.body</IJS>.
        </p>
        <PrismBlock lang="jsx">
          {`function render({ response }) {
  const { body:Body } = response;
  return <Body />;
}`}
        </PrismBlock>
        <p>
          That isn’t perfect because it doesn’t consider what happens when there
          is no body (which happens if none of the routes match the location or
          you don't set it in a route's <IJS>match.response</IJS> function).
        </p>
        <Note>
          Wildcard routes (<IJS>{`{ path: '(.*)' }`}</IJS>) can be used to
          easily display a not found page for any location not matched by other
          routes.
        </Note>
        <p>
          Let’s get back to our <IJS>response</IJS> object. In the React Router
          section, we had three components that were rendered: <Cmp>App</Cmp>,
          <Cmp>Inbox</Cmp>, and <Cmp>Message</Cmp>. With Curi, only the most
          accurately matched route actually matches. That means that for the URI{" "}
          <IJS>/inbox/test-message-please-ignore</IJS>, the <IJS>"Message"</IJS>{" "}
          route will match, but its parent route, <IJS>"Inbox"</IJS> will not.
          The <IJS>response.body</IJS> will be the <Cmp>Message</Cmp> component,
          so that is what our <IJS>render</IJS> function will render. We don’t
          render <Cmp>Inbox</Cmp> because we did not match the <IJS>inbox</IJS>{" "}
          route.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was mentioned above that there is no need for the <Cmp>App</Cmp>{" "}
          component with Curi. If you want to have an <Cmp>App</Cmp> component,
          you can render it either inside of the <IJS>render</IJS> function or
          as a parent of your <Cmp>CuriProvider</Cmp>. This can be useful for
          rendering content that is unrelated to specific routes, like a page
          header or menu.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rendering the <Cmp>App</Cmp> inside of the render function is
          necessary if any of the components rendered by the <Cmp>App</Cmp> are
          location aware components, since they need to access the Curi router
          (through React’s context, which the <Cmp>CuriProvider</Cmp> provides)
        </p>
        <PrismBlock lang="jsx">
          {`function render({ response }) {
  const { body:Body } = response;
  return (
    <App>

}
// or
function render({ response }) {
  const { body:Body } = response;
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <Body />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}`}
        </PrismBlock>
        <p>
          What about props that you want to send to your route components? Just
          pass them to the <Cmp>Body</Cmp> component that you render.
        </p>
        <PrismBlock lang="jsx">
          {`function render({ response }) {
  const { body:Body, data, params } = response;
  return <Body data={data} params={params} />;
}`}
        </PrismBlock>
        <p>
          The one catch here is that you will be passing the same props to all
          of your route components. You could add fine-grained control by using{" "}
          <IJS>response.name</IJS> and a <IJS>switch</IJS> or <IJS>if</IJS>/<IJS
          >
            else
          </IJS>{" "}
          chain, but this is probably overkill. If you’re worried about
          polluting the route component’s props, just pass the whole response
          object.

        You obviously will want to be able to navigate between routes in your
        application. React Router provides a <Cmp>Link</Cmp> component to do
        this, and so does Curi (through the <IJS>@curi/react</IJS> package).
        There are a few differences to note between these two components:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            React Router expects you to generate the pathname yourself, while
            Curi expects you to pass the name of the route that you want to
            navigate to. Any path parameters are passed to Curi’s{" "}
            <Cmp>Link</Cmp> using the <IJS>params</IJS> prop.
          </p>
          <PrismBlock lang="jsx">
            {`// React Router
<Link to='/'>Home</Link>
<Link to={\`/inbox/\${message}\`}>Hello</Link>
// Curi
<Link to='Home'>Home</Link>
<Link to='Message' params={{ message }}>Hello</Link>`}
          </PrismBlock>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            With React Router, any additional location properties are passed to
            the <Cmp>Link</Cmp> using the <IJS>to</IJS> object. With Curi, these
            properties are passed using the <IJS>details</IJS> prop.
          </p>
          <PrismBlock lang="jsx">
            {`// React Router
<Link to={{ pathname: '/inbox', hash: '#test' }}>Inbox</Link>
// Curi
<Link to='Inbox' details={{ hash: 'test' }}>Inbox</Link>`}
          </PrismBlock>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Active detection with Curi is more complicated than with React
            Router, but also more powerful. With Curi, you provide a{" "}
            <IJS>merge</IJS> function that receives the props that will used to
            render the <Cmp>a</Cmp> and allows you to modify/add props. You can
            also pass <IJS>partial: true</IJS> to allow for partial matches to
            be considered active (the opposite of React Router's{" "}
            <IJS>onlyActiveOnIndex</IJS>).
          </p>
          <PrismBlock lang="jsx">
            {`// React Router
<Link
  to='/'
  onlyActiveOnIndex
  activeClassName='active'
>Home</Link>
// Curi
// You need to add @curi/addon-active to your router object
import createActiveAddon from '@curi/addon-active';
const router = curi(history, routes, {
  createActiveAddon
});

// pass the merge function to your <Link>. The props it returns
// will be passed to the anchor rendered by the <Link>
function merge(props) {
  props.className = 'active';
  return props;
}
<Link
  to='Home'
  active={{ merge }}
>Home</Link>`}
          </PrismBlock>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        React Router provides a <IJS>withRouter</IJS> higher-order component
        that will inject router props into the wrapped component. Curi provides
        similar functionality with the <IJS>curious</IJS> higher-order component
        provided by the <IJS>@curi/react</IJS> package.
      </p>
      <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
        {`export default withRouter(SomeComponent);
export default curious(SomeComponent);`}
      </PrismBlock>
      <p>
        <IJS>curious</IJS> will inject the Curi router and the current response
        object into the wrapped component.

      At this point, hopefully you are comfortable with migrating from React
      Router v2/3 to Curi. If there are any concepts not covered here that you
      think should be, please feel free to open up an issue{" "}
