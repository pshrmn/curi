      <p>There are a couple things to keep in mind when using Svelte:</p>
      <p>
        The first is that <Cmp>Link</Cmp>s need to access your Curi router in
        order to navigate/create <IJS>href</IJS>s. In theory you can pass this
        purely through component attributes, but that can get old quite quickly.
        Instead, <IJS>@curi/svelte</IJS> provides a <IJS>setrouter</IJS>{" "}
        function to store your router, allowing the <Cmp>Link</Cmp> to just
        import it. Once you have created your router, you should call{" "}
        <IJS>setrouter(router)</IJS> (where router is your router).
      </p>
      <p>
        The second thing is how to re-render your application when the location
        changes. By having the route's <IJS>response()</IJS> function set Svelte
        render functions as the response's <IJS>body</IJS> we can just call{" "}
        <IJS>response.body</IJS> to render our view. We will also want to
        destroy the current view before doing this. All of this should be done
        in a response handler function (<IJS>router.respond(fn)</IJS>).
