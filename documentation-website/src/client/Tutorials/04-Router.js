    <h1>Part 4: The Curi Router</h1>
    <p>
      Curi uses a centralized router to handle routing. Essentially, whenever
      the location changes (and when your application first loads), the router
      will iterate over your routes to find one that matches the location. Then,
      it will use that route to generate a response object. This response
      contains a bunch of properties that are useful for rendering your
      application.

    <Section title="Creating our router" id="create">
      <p>
        <IJS>@curi/core</IJS> only has a single, default export, which is a
        function that will create a router. In this tutorial, we will import it
        as <IJS>curi</IJS> (of course, you can name it whatever you like).
      </p>
      <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
        {`import curi from '@curi/core';`}
      </PrismBlock>
      <p>
        <IJS>curi</IJS> can take three arguments; the first two arguments are
        required while the third is not.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <IJS>history</IJS> - The first argument to pass to <IJS>curi</IJS> is
          a Hickory history object.
        </li>
        <li>
          <IJS>routes</IJS> - The second argument is an array of route objects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <IJS>options</IJS> - The third argument is an object that contains
          additional configuration options. We will not be using this object in
          this tutorial.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Using the routes that we defined in the{" "}
        <Link to="Tutorial" params={{ name: "02-routes" }}>
          Routes Tutorial
        </Link>{" "}
        and the{" "}
        <Link to="Tutorial" params={{ name: "03-hickory" }}>
          Hickory history object
        </Link>, we are ready to create our router.
      </p>
      <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
        {`// src/index.js
import curi from '@curi/core';
import Browser from '@hickory/browser';

import routes from './routes';

const history = Browser();
const router = curi(history, routes);`}

    <Section title="Observe" id="observer" type="aside">
      <p>
        The Curi router uses the{" "}
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern">
          observer pattern
        </a>. Callback functions (referred to here as response handlers) are
        registered with the router. Whenever the user navigates inside your
        application, the router will craete a new response object and call the
        response handlers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Registration is done using the router's <IJS>respond</IJS> method. If a
        response already exists when <IJS>router.respond</IJS> is called, then
        the response handler will be called immediately. If the initial response
        hasn't resolved, then the response handler will be called once it does.
      </p>
      <p>
        A response handler receives an object with three properties:{" "}
        <IJS>response</IJS>, <IJS>navigation</IJS>, and <IJS>router</IJS>. The{" "}
        <Link
          to="Guide"
          params={{ slug: "responses" }}
          details={{ hash: "response-properties" }}
        >
          <IJS>response</IJS>
        </Link>{" "}
        contains information about the route that matched the new location, the{" "}
        <IJS>navigation</IJS> contains navigation data that doesn't belong in a{" "}
        <IJS>response</IJS>, and the <IJS>router</IJS> is your Curi router.
      </p>
      <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
        {`function responseLogger({ response, navigation, router }) {
  console.log("[response]", response);
  console.log("[navigation]", navigation);
  console.log("[router]", router);
}
router.respond(responseLogger);`}
      </PrismBlock>
      <Note>
        By default, the response handler will only be called one time. This is
        useful for setup functions that you only want to call once. However, a
        response handler can also be registered to be called every time a new
        response is emitted by using the <IJS>{`{ observe: true }`}</IJS>{" "}
        option. In general, you shouldn't have to do this yourself about this
        because the rendering packages like <IJS>@curi/react</IJS> and{" "}
        <IJS>@curi/vue</IJS> will set this up automatically.
        <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
          {`function responseLogger() {
  console.log("I will be called for every response");
}
const stopResponding = router.respond(
  responseLogger,
  { observe: true }
);
// any navigation that happens now will be logged
// ...
stopResponding();
// response are no longer logged`}
