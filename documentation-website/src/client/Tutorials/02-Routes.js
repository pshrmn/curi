    <h1>Part 2: Curi Routes</h1>
    <p>
      Now that we have our project setup, it is time to start thinking about the
      route structure of our website.
    </p>
    <Outline>
      <ul>
        <li>Deciding what pages our website will contain.</li>
        <li>Learning about basic route properties.</li>
        <li>Creating route objects for each of our website's pages.</li>
      </ul>
    </Outline>
    <TutorialBranch name="02-routes" />
    <Section title="Pages" id="pages">
      <p>
        We should start by identifying the pages that we want to have in our
        website. This can always be modified later, but it is a good idea to
        know what pages you are going to need to create.
      </p>
      <p>For this website, we will be creating the following pages:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Home - the landing page for the website</li>
        <li>Contact - a listing of how to contact the site's creators</li>
        <li>Book list - a list of all of the books available for purchase</li>
        <li>Book - a page for each book</li>
        <li>
          Checkout - a page to "buy" books that have been added to the shopping
          cart
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Additionally, we should have a 404 page that is displayed when the user
        visits a location that has no matching route.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each page in our website must have a pathname associated with it. These
        may either be static (literal) or dynamic (include parts that change,
        like IDs).
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Home - <IJS>/</IJS>
        </li>
        <li>
          Contact - <IJS>/contact</IJS>
        </li>
        <li>
          Book list - <IJS>/books</IJS>
        </li>
        <li>
          Book - <IJS>/books/&lt;book id&gt;</IJS> e.g. <IJS>/books/2468</IJS>
        </li>
        <li>
          Checkout - <IJS>/checkout</IJS>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </Section>

    <Section title="Routes" id="routes">
      <p>
        At their core, routes are a way to describe the valid pathnames for our
        website. With Curi, routes are simply JavaScript objects with some known
        properties. The two most important properties of a route object are{" "}
        <IJS>name</IJS> and <IJS>path</IJS>. The <IJS>name</IJS> is a{" "}
        <strong>unique</strong> string that you will use to identify a
        particular route. The <IJS>path</IJS> is a{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp">
          <IJS>path-to-regexp</IJS>
        </a>{" "}
        formatted string.
      </p>
      <Note>
        <IJS>path-to-regexp</IJS> provides pathname matching. You give it a path
        string (possibly with special formatting) and it returns a regular
        expression that can be used for matching routes. The regular expression
        matching will be handled internally by Curi, so you only have to care
        about formatting path strings. Further along in this tutorial, we will
        cover the basics of how to do this. However, for advanced usage, you
        should check out the documention in the{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp">
          <IJS>path-to-regexp</IJS>
        </a>{" "}
        GitHub repo.
      </Note>
      <p>
        All of the base routes of our application should be placed in an array.
        Nested routes will be defined using a property of their parent route.
      </p>
      <PrismBlock lang="javascript">{`// src/routes.js
        const routes = [];`}</PrismBlock>
      <p>
        The first route that we will define is for our homepage. We can name it
        anything we want, but we'll just call it "Home". For the home page's{" "}
        <IJS>path</IJS>, we will use an empty string (<IJS>''</IJS>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Up above, we said that the pathname for our "Home" route is <IJS>/</IJS>.
        However, with Curi, <IJS>path</IJS> strings never begin with a forward
        slash. For all of the pathnames for pages that are listed above, we just
        need to strip off the leading slash.
      </p>
      <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
        {`const routes = [
  { name: 'Home', path: '' }
];`}
      </PrismBlock>
      <p>
        That is simple enough, yes? Let's go ahead and add our "Contact" and
        "Checkout" routes. They should look just like our "Home" route.
      </p>
      <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
        {`const routes = [
  { name: 'Home', path: '' },
  { name: 'Contact', path: 'contact' },
  { name: 'Checkout', path: 'checkout' }
];`}
      </PrismBlock>
      <p>
        Now, if a user visits{" "}
        <IJS>https://&lt;our website domain&gt;/checkout</IJS>, our checkout
        page will match (and likewise for <IJS>/contact</IJS> and our contact
        page).
      </p>
      <p>
        We still have more routes to define, but there are two concepts to
        introduce first: path params and the <IJS>children</IJS> property of
        route objects.
      </p>
      <Subsection title="Path Params" id="path-params" type="aside">
        <p>
          With <IJS>path-to-regexp</IJS>, when you create a path string, it is
          normally interpreted literally. That means that the the path{" "}
          <IJS>'products/hat'</IJS> will only match the location whose pathname
          is <IJS>/products/hat</IJS>. What if we also have a shirt? And socks?
          And shorts? Do you want to define a path for each individual product?
          Of course not. Instead, <IJS>path-to-regexp</IJS> allows us to define
          dynamic parts of pathnames using "params".
        </p>
        <p>
          What is a param? It is a way to tell <IJS>path-to-regexp</IJS> to
          capture part of the pathname at a particular point and store its value
          using the param's name. The param starts with a colon and then
          specifies the param's name.
        </p>
        <PrismBlock lang="javascript">{`{ path: 'product/:name' }`}</PrismBlock>
        <p>
          Using the above path, we will capture the portion of the pathname that
          comes after <IJS>product/</IJS> and store it in an object using the
          key "name". When you visit <IJS>'/products/hat'</IJS>,{" "}
          <IJS>path-to-regexp</IJS> will match and return the params object{" "}
          <IJS>{`{ name: 'hat' }`}</IJS>. Likewise, <IJS>'/products/shirt'</IJS>{" "}
          and <IJS>'/products/shorts'</IJS> will capture "shirt" and "shorts" as
          the name param.
        </p>
        <p>
          By default, a param will match all characters up until the next
          forward slash or the end of the string. You can also perform more
          specific matching, but that is outside of the scope of this tutorial.
        </p>
      </Subsection>
      <Subsection title="Route Children" id="children" type="aside">
        <p>
          Sometimes, you will have routes whose <IJS>path</IJS> extends the path
          of another route. For example, you might have a route whose path is{" "}
          <IJS>'parent'</IJS> and a child route with the path{" "}
          <IJS>'parent/child'</IJS>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the <IJS>children</IJS> property of route objects, you can
          attach an array of child routes to a parent route. The <IJS>path</IJS>{" "}
          of each child route will extend the parent route's <IJS>path</IJS>.
          That means that using the parent/child paths from above, we can define
          the parent route to have the path <IJS>'parent'</IJS> and a child
          route whose path is <IJS>'child'</IJS>. Curi will treat that child
          route as if its path is <IJS>'parent/child'</IJS>.
        </p>
        <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
          {`{
  name: 'Parent',
  path: 'parent',
  children: [
    {
      name: 'Child',
      path: 'child' // will match the pathname /parent/child
    }
  ]
}`}
        </PrismBlock>
      </Subsection>

      <p>
        Now, we can go ahead and use path params and route children to define
        our book list/book routes.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this tutorial, we will identify books from a pathname using their{" "}
        <IJS>id</IJS>. We can name this anything we want, but "id" is simple and
        to the point.
      </p>
      <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
        {`const routes = [
  { name: 'Home', path: '' },
  { name: 'Contact', path: 'contact' },
  { name: 'Checkout', path: 'checkout' },
  {
    name: 'Book List',
    path: 'books',
    children: [
      {
        name: 'Book',
        path: ':id'
      }
    ]
  }
];`}
      </PrismBlock>

      <Subsection title="route.match" id="route-match">
        <p>
          We don't need it quite yet, but we should quickly cover another one of
          the properties of a route: <IJS>match</IJS>. The <IJS>match</IJS>{" "}
          property is where we can provide functions that will be called when
          the route matches. There are three valid functions: <IJS>initial</IJS>,{" "}
          <IJS>every</IJS>, and <IJS>response</IJS>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We won't be using the <IJS>initial</IJS> function, but you can read
          more about it in the{" "}
          <Link to="Guide" params={{ slug: "code-splitting" }}>
            Code Splitting
          </Link>{" "}
          guide. The <IJS>every</IJS> function will be used later on, but for
          now, we only care about the <IJS>response</IJS> function.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <IJS>response</IJS> function gives us an opportunity to set some
          properties on the response object before it is emitted.{" "}
          <IJS>response</IJS> receives an object with are a bunch of properties
          (which you can read about{" "}
          <Link
            to="Guide"
            params={{ slug: "routes" }}
            details={{ hash: "response" }}
          >
            here
          </Link>), but right now we only care about the <IJS>set</IJS> object.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <IJS>set</IJS> object has functions that can be called to modify
          the response object. For example, calling <IJS>set.body('Hi!')</IJS>{" "}
          will set the <IJS>body</IJS> property of the response to "Hi!". Let's
          go ahead and add <IJS>match.response</IJS> functions to each of our
          routes. We don't really have anything to set as the body, so we'll
          just use the route's name as a placeholder.
        </p>
        <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
          {`const routes = [
  {
    name: 'Home',
    path: '',
    match: {
      response: ({ set }) => {
        set.body('Home');
      }
    }
  },
  {
    name: 'Contact',
    path: 'contact',
    match: {
      response: ({ set }) => {
        set.body('Contact');
      }
    }
  },
  {
    name: 'Checkout',
    path: 'checkout',
    match: {
      response: ({ set }) => {
        set.body('Checkout');
      }
    }
  },
  {
    name: 'Book List',
    path: 'books',
    match: {
      response: ({ set }) => {
        set.body('Book List');
      }
    },
    children: [
      {
        name: 'Book',
        path: ':id',
        match: {
          response: ({ set }) => {
            set.body('Book');
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
];`}
        </PrismBlock>
        <p>
          Now, if a user visits the <IJS>/books</IJS> page, the response object
          will include a <IJS>body</IJS> property whose value is "Book List".
        </p>
      </Subsection>

      <Subsection title="Wildcard Routes" id="wildcard">
        <p>
          We have one last "route" to define. This isn't really a route, just a
          catch all that we can use to identify locations that we don't have a
          route defined for. <IJS>path-to-regexp</IJS> allows us to capture
          everything using the path string <IJS>(.*)</IJS>.
        </p>
        <Note>
          <IJS>(.*)</IJS> uses another of the special <IJS>path-to-regexp</IJS>{" "}
          formats. If you provide a regular expression within parentheses,{" "}
          <IJS>path-to-regexp</IJS> will only match content that is matched by
          the regular expression. This can also be paired with a named path
          param (e.g. <IJS>{`:id(\\d\{4\})`}</IJS>), but is not necessary.
        </Note>
        <p>
          Since the regular expression <IJS>.*</IJS> matches everything, we can
          use this to match all possible pathnames that someone using the
          website might navigate to.
        </p>
        <PrismBlock lang="javascript">

      </Subsection>
      <Subsection title="Route Order" id="order">
        <p>
          One last thing to note about routes is that their order in the routes
          array is important. Curi will iterate over them in (depth-first)
          order. This means that with the above router, Curi will first check if{" "}
          <IJS>''</IJS> matches the pathname, if it does not, it will move on to{" "}
          <IJS>'contact'</IJS>, so on and so forth. If no other routes match,
          then we know that our "Not Found" route will.
        </p>
        <p>
          Curi will only attempt to match children routes if their parent route
          (partially) matches the location's pathname. That means that when the
          pathname is <IJS>'/somewhere'</IJS>, because our "Book List" route
          does not match, Curi will not attempt to match our "Book" route.
