    <h1>Part 8: Forms & Programmatic Navigation</h1>
    <p>
      In this tutorial, we are going to be using another property of our Curi
      router: <IJS>history</IJS>. This property is our Hickory history instance.
      We will use it to perform navigation between pages in our website.

    <Section id="A Little Babel" title="babel">
      <p>
        Up until now, we have used stateless functional React components. In
        this tutorial, we will be using classes (extending{" "}
        <IJS>React.Component</IJS>). To help us, we will be taking advantage of
        some class properties, so we need to install the propert Babel plugin to
        support this and add it to our Babel configuration.
      </p>
      <PrismBlock lang="bash">
        {`npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties`}
      </PrismBlock>
      <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
        {`// .babelrc.js
module.exports = {
  // ...,
  plugins: ['@babel/proposal-class-properties']
};
`}
      </PrismBlock>
    </Section>
    <Section title="The (Fake) API" id="API">
      <p>
        Since we do not have a backend to store the books that a user wants to
        purchase, we will simulate this using <IJS>localStorage</IJS>. This will
        be done by maintaining an object whose keys are book <IJS>id</IJS>s and
        whose values is how many of that book should be purchased.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our API should export three methods: the first will get the current
        state of the shopping cart, the second will update the shopping cart,
        and the third will reset the shopping cart.
      </p>
      <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
        {`// src/api/shoppingCart.js
function saveCart(cart) {
  localStorage.setItem('cart', JSON.stringify(cart));
}

// read from localStorage and parse the value
export function getCart() {
  let cart = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('cart'));
  // initialize cart if it doesn't already exist
  if (cart == null) {
    cart = {};
    saveCart(cart);
  }
  return Promise.resolve(cart);
}

// add the book and count to the cart
export function updateCart(bookID, count) {
  return getCart()
    .then(cart => {
      cart[bookID] = count;
      saveCart(cart);
      return cart;
    });
}

// reset the cart to an empty object
export function resetCart() {
  const cart = {};
  saveCart(cart);
}`}
      </PrismBlock>
      <Note>
        We are using <IJS>localStorage</IJS>, which is synchronous, but our API
        functions return Promises to simulate having to make these requests to
        the server.
      </Note>
      <p>
        We will need to access this API in two places. Our "Book" pages need to
        use <IJS>updateCart</IJS> in order to add books to the shopping cart.
        The "Checkout" page need to know which books (and how many of each) are
        currently in the shopping cart. The page should also clear the cart out
        after a user has "purchased" the book in their shopping cart.
      </p>
    </Section>
    <Section title="Adding Books to the Shopping Cart" id="add-books">
      <p>
        On the "Book" page, users should be able to specify how many copies of a
        book they want to purchase and add those to their shopping cart. We will
        do this by adding a new component, <Cmp>AddToCart</Cmp>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can start by creating a component with renders a <Cmp>select</Cmp>.
        Users can buy 1-4 copies of a book (an arbitrary restriction), so we
        need an <Cmp>option</Cmp> for each possible value. We should also add an{" "}
        <IJS>onChange</IJS> handler to update the <Cmp>select</Cmp> when the
        user changes the value.
      </p>
      <PrismBlock lang="jsx">
        {`// src/components/AddToCart.js
import React from 'react';

class AddToCart extends React.Component {
  state = { count: 1 }

  updateSelect = (event) => {
    this.setState({ count: parseInt(event.target.value, 10) })
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form>
        <select value={this.state.count} onChange={this.updateSelect}>
          <option value='1'>1</option>
          <option value='2'>2</option>
          <option value='3'>3</option>
          <option value='4'>4</option>
        </select>
      </form>
    );
  }
}

export default AddToCart;`}
      </PrismBlock>
      <p>
        Next, we need to add a button to add the book to the shopping cart.
        We're actually going to add two buttons. The first will just add the
        book/count to the shopping cart. The second will add the book/count to
        the shopping cart and then redirect to the "Checkout" page.
      </p>
      <p>
        How will we redirect? So far, all navigation within the website has been
        performed using <Cmp>Link</Cmp>s. However, sometimes you might want to
        navigate programmatically. To do this, we can take advantage of our
        Hickory history object. The history object has <IJS>push</IJS>,{" "}
        <IJS>replace</IJS>, and <IJS>update</IJS> methods that we can call to
        trigger navigation. You can read about each of these in the{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/pshrmn/hickory/blob/master/docs/api/Browser.md#methods">
          Hickory documentation
        </a>. For this tutorial, we will be using <IJS>push</IJS>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to access the router from within our component we will use the{" "}
        <IJS>curious</IJS> higher order component from <IJS>@curi/react</IJS>. A
        component that is wrapped by <IJS>curious</IJS> will have the Curi
        router injected as a prop called <IJS>curi</IJS>. That means that we can
        call <IJS>this.props.curi.history.push</IJS> (a bit of a mouthful) to
        automatically redirect to another page.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can also access all of our Curi <IJS>addons</IJS> from our router, so
        we will use <IJS>curi.addons.pathname</IJS> to generate the pathname for
        the location that we wan to redirect to.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the user clicks either of the buttons, we will want to use the{" "}
        <IJS>updateCart</IJS> API method to add the book to the shopping cart.
        The <Cmp>AddToCart</Cmp> component doesn't inherently know which book it
        is for, so we will need to pass it the <IJS>id</IJS> of the book as a
        prop when we render it.
      </p>
      <PrismBlock lang="jsx">
        {`// src/components/AddToCart.js
import React from 'react';
import { curious } from '@curi/react';

import { updateCart } from '../api/shoppingCart';

class AddToCart extends React.Component {

  state = { count: 1 }

  updateSelect = (event) => {
    this.setState({ count: parseInt(event.target.value, 10) })
  }

  addToCart = () => {
    updateCart(this.props.bookID, this.state.count);
  }

  addAndCheckout = () => {
    const { curi, bookID } = this.props;
    updateCart(bookID, this.state.count)
      .then(() => {
        // generate the pathname for the Checkout route and then
        // navigate to there automatically
        const pathname = curi.addons.pathname('Checkout');
        curi.history.push({ pathname });
      });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form>
        <select value={this.state.count} onChange={this.updateSelect}>
          <option value='1'>1</option>

export default curious(AddToCart);`}

      <p>
        Now, we can modify our <Cmp>Book</Cmp> component to render the{" "}
        <Cmp>AddToCart</Cmp> component. Remember that we need to pass it a{" "}
        <IJS>bookID</IJS> prop so that we can know which book to add to the
        shopping cart.

      <PrismBlock lang="jsx">

    </Section>
    <Section title="The Checkout Page" id="checkout">
      <p>
        Now that we can add books to our shopping cart, we also should give the
        user the ability to buy them. Of course, this isn't a real store website
        that we are building, so instead of asking for payment and shipping
        information, we will just redirect the user once they "purchase" their
        books.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's start out in our <IJS>routes.js</IJS> file. We want our "Checkout"
        page to know which books are in the shopping cart. We can use the{" "}
        <IJS>match.every</IJS> function of the "Checkout" route to load all of
        the books and our shopping cart. We can merge the two together to create
        an array of items in the cart.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we're at it, we should also add one more route to our website.
        This will be a "Checkout Complete" route that we redirect to after a
        user has "purchased" their books.

      <p>
        Before we update our <Cmp>Checkout</Cmp> component, let's write the{" "}
