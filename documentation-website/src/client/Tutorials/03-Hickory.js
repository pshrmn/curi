    <h1>Part 3: Hickory</h1>
    <p>
      One thing that all modern JavaScript routers have in common is that they
      use the{" "}
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API">
        History API
      </a>{" "}
      to perform in-app navigation. Curi uses a package called{" "}
      <a href="https://github.com/pshrmn/hickory">Hickory</a>, which will
      interact with the History API for us.

    <Section title="About Hickory" id="about">
      <p>
        Hickory creates "history" objects that allow you to navigate between
        locations within your application. It interacts with the browser for you
        so that when you navigate to a new location, the URI in the address bar
        is also updated. Hickory also detects and updates when you use the
        browser's forward and back buttons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hickory uses a single-subscriber model so that whenever navigation to a
        new location happens, the subscribed method will be called. Curi will
        subscribe to your history object to create new responses whenever the
        location changes.
      </p>
    </Section>
    <Section title="Choose your own Hickory" id="choose">
      <p>
        Hickory is split into three packages: <IJS>@hickory/browser</IJS>,{" "}
        <IJS>@hickory/hash</IJS>, and <IJS>@hickory/in-memory</IJS>. You can
        read about the differences between them and figure out which is right
        for you in this{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/pshrmn/hickory/blob/master/docs/about/choosing.md">

        guide.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will be using the browser history (<IJS>@hickory/browser</IJS>). This
        is because 1. our application will run in the browser and 2. our site is
        backed by a server that can handle dynamic requests.

      <p>
        In order to use Hickory in our application, we just need to import it
        and call the imported function. There are a number of configuration
        options that you can provide, but we don't need any of those right now.
        If you want to learn more about those, please check out the{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/pshrmn/hickory/tree/master/docs">
          Hickory documentation
        </a>.
      </p>
      <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
        {`// src/index.js
          import Browser from '@hickory/browser';
const history = Browser();`}
      </PrismBlock>
    </Section>
    <Section title="Location" id="hickory-location" type="aside">
      <p>
        Hickory (and Curi in turn) use location objects for navigation and route
        matching. These are simply JavaScript objects with a few properties to
        identify a location.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you load a page, Hickory will parse the URI to generate a
        location's <IJS>pathname</IJS>, <IJS>query</IJS>, and <IJS>hash</IJS>{" "}
        properties. The pathname property of a location is the only thing that{" "}
        <IJS>path-to-regexp</IJS> uses for matching locations.
      </p>
      <PrismBlock lang="javascript">
        {`// uri = '/products/socks?color=black#description'
{
 pathname: '/products/socks',
 query: 'color=black',
 hash: 'description',
 key: '1.0',
 rawPathname: '/products/socks'
}`}
      </PrismBlock>
      <p>
        Besides the properties parsed from the URI, locations also have a{" "}
        <IJS>key</IJS> property that can be used to uniquely identify a
        location, a <IJS>rawPathname</IJS> property (you probably won't need
        this, but it is useful when dealing with pathnames that contain encoded
        characters), and sometimes <IJS>state</IJS> which is data tied to a
        location but not part of the URI.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hickory actually navigates between locations, not URIs. The only time
        that Curi/Hickory uses URIs is to set the <IJS>href</IJS> attribute of
        anchors and to update the string displayed in the address bar (using the
        History API).
      </p>

      <p>
        For now, that will cover all that you need to know about Hickory. For
        basic usage, you should never have to think about it except for creating
        your history object.
