          A <Cmp>Link</Cmp> allows you to navigate within your application using
          an anchor element (<Cmp>a</Cmp>). When the rendered element is
          clicked, instead of reloading the page it will use your router
          object's history object to navigate.

        <p>
          With the <Cmp>Link</Cmp>, instead of providing a URI to navigate to,
          you just need to specify the name of the route you want to link to.
          Then, the pathname of the URI you want the component to link to will
          be automatically generated for you.
        </p>

              If the route that you want to navigate to (or any of its parents)
              include path parameters, you can specify them using the params
              prop.

              generated for you, this does not cover over location properties
              (query, hash, and state). You can provide these values using the
              details prop.

            <Note>
              You can also include a pathname property in the details object and

            <p>
              By default, when you render a <Cmp>Link</Cmp>, an anchor element
              will be rendered (<IJS>React.createElement('a', ...)</IJS>).
              However, you can provide your own component to be rendered
              instead. This can be useful for using styled components to
              navigate.
            </p>
            <Warning>
              You can provide any component that you want, but you{" "}
              <em>should</em> stick with an anchor (or a component that renders
              an anchor). There are accessibility issues that will occur when
              you use other DOM elements as links. The component's prop type is
              func in an attempt to discourage you from making your link render
              a button, div, span, etc.

          <Subsection tag="h4" title="active" id="Link-active">
            <p>
              The active prop gives you an opportunity to style the element
              rendered by the <Cmp>Link</Cmp> when it is "active". Being active
              means that the <Cmp>Link</Cmp>'s route parameters are the same as
              the current response's route parameters. This{" "}
              <strong>does not</strong> take into account any query parameters
              or the hash.
            </p>
            <p>
              The active prop is an object with two properties. The first one,
              merge is required. The merge property must be a function. That
              function's argument is the props object that will be passed used
              to render the element rendered by the <Cmp>Link</Cmp>. The merge
              function can modify these props however it likes. It must return
              the resulting props object.

            </PrismBlock>
            <p>
              The second property of the active object is partial. By default,
              only <Cmp>Link</Cmp>s that match the response object's name can be
              considered "active". However, when partial is true, any parent
              routes can also be "active". This is done using the response
              object's partials property.
