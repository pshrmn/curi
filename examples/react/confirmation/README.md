# Navigation Confirmation

[CodeSandbox demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pshrmn/curi/tree/master/examples/react/confirmation)

If navigation away from a page will cause the user to lose unsaved data, you may want to add a navigation confirmation. This will give them a chance to cancel the navigation and not lose the unsaved data.
