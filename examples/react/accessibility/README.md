# React + Curi Accessibility

[CodeSandbox demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pshrmn/curi/tree/master/examples/react/accessibility)

This is a very simple application that demonstrates using React with a Curi application. This uses the `useNavigationFocus` hook provided by the `@curi/react-dom` package.
