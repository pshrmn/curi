# Multi body example

[CodeSandbox demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pshrmn/curi/tree/master/examples/react/multi-body)

Sometimes, you may want to have multiple components attached to a route. When this is the case, all you have to do is set an object instead of the specific component.

```js
import { HomeMenu, Home } from './components/Home';

{
  name: 'Home',
  match: {
    respond() {
      return {
        body: {
          main: Home,
          menu: HomeMenu
        }
      };
    }
  }
}
```
