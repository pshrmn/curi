# Basic React + Curi

[CodeSandbox demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pshrmn/curi/tree/master/examples/react/basic)

This is a very simple application that demonstrates using React with a Curi application. This uses the `create_router_component()` higher-order component and the `<Link>` component provided by the `@curi/react-dom` package.
