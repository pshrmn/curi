The prefetch addon enables you to run a `uri`'s `load` function prior to actually navigating to that location. This is only useful for in-app navigation. If the user uses the browser's forward/back buttons, the loading will be handled within the Curi configuration object.

**Note:** If you use this addon, then your `load` functions should be caching the data. This is because the route's `load` function is always called when generating a response, effectively making a duplicate call.

**Another Note:** This package is experimental and I'm still not convinced that it is necessary. This might be highly modified or even removed in the future.

## Installation

```js
npm install --save @curi/addon-prefetch
```
