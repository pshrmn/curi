## 1.0.0-beta.4

* Switch to TypeScript

## 1.0.0-beta.3

* Switched to scoped package: `@curi/addon-ancestors`.

## 1.0.0-beta.1

* Getting close to where this should be ready for release, so switching to beta version.

## 0.2.1

* When get is called with no arguments, it returns a copy of the array. This prevents bugs from happening when the user manipulates the received array.

## 0.2.0

* New build (uses Rollup to output a single file for each build type).
