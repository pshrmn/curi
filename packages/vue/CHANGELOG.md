## 2.0.0-alpha.6

* Remove `forward` prop from link components.

## 2.0.0-alpha.4

* Use `router.url`.

## 2.0.0-alpha.3

* Rename `<curi-link>`'s `to` prop to `name`.
* Split `<curi-link>` into two components. `<curi-link>` is static (regular slot) while `<curi-async-link>` tracks navigating state (scoped slot).
* `<curi-link>` and `<curi-async-link>` take a `forward` prop, which is an object whose properties will be spread onto the rendered anchor.

## 2.0.0-alpha.2

* Fix UMD builds.

## 2.0.0-alpha.0

* Bump to `v2` alpha since it uses `@curi/router` v2.

## 1.0.0-beta.30

* Import common Curi types from `@curi/types`.

## 1.0.0-beta.29

* `<curi-link>` uses `history.href`.

## 1.0.0-beta.27

* Use snake cased `history.to_href`

## 1.0.0-beta.26

* Remove `curi-block` component
* Use `SessionLocation` type

## 1.0.0-beta.25

* Add `sideEffects: false` hint for Webpack.

## 1.0.0-beta.24

* `v-curi-focus` takes a `FocusDirectiveProperties` object with `key` (re-focus on `key` value change), `preserve` (don't steal focus from already focused child element), and `preventScroll` (don't scroll to focused element) properties.

## 1.0.0-beta.23

* Revert dual-mode (not ready yet!).

## 1.0.0-beta.22

* Support dual-mode package (CJS/ESM) builds.

## 1.0.0-beta.21

* Fix bad `@curi/route-active` dependency.
* Switch script builds from IIFE to UMD.

## 1.0.0-beta.20

* `curi-focus` uses a 0 second timeout to delay focusing.

## 1.0.0-beta.19

* Add a `curi-focus` directive to auto-focus an element when new responses are emitted.

## 1.0.0-beta.18

* Add scoped slot to `<curi-link>` for accessing the link's `navigating` state.

## 1.0.0-beta.17

* Add `hash`, `query`, and `state` props to `<curi-link>`, remove `details`.
* Remove `active` prop from `<curi-link>`.

## 1.0.0-beta.16

* (Internal) `CuriPlugin`'s response handler uses `router.response(fn, { observe: true })`.
* (Internal) `CuriPlugin`'s response handler receives `Emitted`.

## 1.0.0-beta.15

* Switch from `action` to `navigation` (which contains an `action` as well as the previous `response`).

## 1.0.0-beta.14

* Make router globally available as `$router`.
* Drop `installCuri` and `reactiveCuri`. When it is installed, `CuriPlugin` creates a reactive `$curi` object to update `response`/`action`.

## 1.0.0-beta.13

* Refer to Curi router as `router` not `config`.

## 1.0.0-beta.12

* The `CuriPlugin` now expects to receive a reactive object. If you use `installCuri`, this requires no changes. If you manually install the plugin (using `Vue.use`), you can use the new `reactiveCuri` function to create a reactive object.
* Export all TypeScript types.

## 1.0.0-beta.11

* Add an `extra` prop to the `active` object passed to `<curi-link>`s. This function will be passed the current location and the link's `details`, returning a boolean that is `true` when the link should be active. This allows for making the link active based on the `query`/`hash` properties.
* Removed source maps from `dist`

## 1.0.0-beta.10

* Switch to `config.respond` from `config.subscribe`.
* Export an `installCuri` function to handle registering Curi and automatically updating the `response`/`action` after location changes.
* `CuriPlugin` is now a named export instead of a default export.
* Make the `$curi` object reactive.

## 1.0.0-beta.9

* Add `active` support to the `<curi-link>`, where `active` is an object with a `merge` function and an optional `partial` boolean.
* Expand the `$curi` object to contain `response` and `action` (`this.$curi = { config, response, action }`).

## 1.0.0-beta.8

* `<curi-link>` uses `history.navigate`, not `history.update`.

## 1.0.0-beta.7

* Remove `<curi-redirect>`. This was inspired by React Router, but it doesn't really serve a point. Redirects should either be known pre-render, in which case they can be made in `route.load` or can be manually performed using `curi.history.replace`.

## 1.0.0-beta.6

* Update `<curi-block>` to used watchers instead of `beforeUpdate`. This way, it does not rely on the `<curi-block>` having children to ensure an update.

## 1.0.0-beta.5

* Switch to TypeScript

## 1.0.0-beta.4

* Add `<curi-block>` component for declaratively blocking navigation (until the user confirms).
* Add cases when clicking a `<curi-link>` should not navigate using `hickory`.

## 1.0.0-beta.3

* Switched to scoped package: `@curi/vue`.

## 1.0.0-beta.1

* Getting close to where this should be ready for release, so switching to beta version.

## 0.3.0

* Switch to the [`hickory`](https://github.com/pshrmn/hickory) package for history. With this change, the `Link` component now uses `history.update` instead of `history.push` in order to mimic browser anchor behavior.

## 0.2.0

* New build (uses Rollup to output a single file for each build type).
