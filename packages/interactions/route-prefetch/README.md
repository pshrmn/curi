The `prefetch` route interaction lets you call a route's `on.every()` method outside of route matching.

**Note:** If you use this route interaction, then your `on.every()` functions should be caching the data. This is because the route's `on.every()` function is always called when matching routes. Caching enables you to bail early with the prefetched data.

## Installation

```js
npm install --save @curi/route-prefetch
```
