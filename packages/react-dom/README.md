`@curi/react-dom` provides a number of components to create a React appliation that uses the `curi` package to manage routing. This is in part inspired by React Router, but takes a "flat" approach to rendering components. Instead of nesting route components, only the component associated with the best-matched route will be attached to the response.

## Installation

```
npm install --save @curi/react-dom
```

For more information, please check out the [`@curi/react-dom`](https://curi.js.org/v2/@curi/react-dom/) page on the documentation website.
