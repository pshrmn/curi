      <Section title="Async Routes" id="async">
        <Explanation>
          <p>
            Curi lets you attach async functions to a route, and when that route
            matches, a response will not be emitted until the async functions
            have completed. The results of the async functions will be available
            in a route's <IJS>response()</IJS> function under the{" "}
            <IJS>resolved</IJS> object.
          </p>
          <Note>
            These async functions are called every time a route matches. If you
            have functions that should re-use the results from previous calls,
            you will probably want to implement some caching into your async
            functions. Curi provides a{" "}
            <Link name="Package" params={{ package: "router" }} hash="once">
              <IJS>once()</IJS>
            </Link>{" "}
            function for simple caching, but leaves more advanced caching
            solutions to the user.
          </Note>
          <p>
            The async functions for a route are grouped under the route's{" "}
            <IJS>resolve</IJS> object. The name of each function is the name
            that the function's result will be available as on the{" "}
            <IJS>resolved</IJS> object. If any of the async functions throws an
            error, that error will be available in the <IJS>response()</IJS>{" "}
            function through the <IJS>error</IJS> property.
          </p>
          <p>
            Async functions will be passed an object of the matched route
            properties, which you may use to specify what data to load.
          </p>
          <p>
            Curi uses Promises to manage async code, so async functions should
            return Promises. If you want to return a value, you can use{" "}
            <IJS>Promise.resolve()</IJS> to return it using a Promise.
          </p>
        </Explanation>
        <CodeBlock>
          {`const routes = prepareRoutes([
  {
    name: "A Route",
    path: "route/:id",
    resolve: {
      component: () => import("./components/SomeComponent")
        .then(module => module.default),
      data: ({ params }) => fetch(\`/api/data/$\{params.id\}\`)
    },
    response({ resolved, error }) {
      if (error) {
        // ...
      }
      return {
        body: resolved.component,
        data: resolved.data
      }
    }
  }
]);`}
        </CodeBlock>

        <Explanation>
          <p>
            There is one caveat to async routes: we cannot safely render the
            application immediately on load because the initial response might
            not be ready yet. When a user loads your application and the first
            route that matches has asynchronous functions, there is no response
            to render until the async code finishes. This means that if you
            attempt to render immediately after creating a router, the{" "}
            <IJS>response</IJS> that will be passed to the <Cmp>Router</Cmp>'s{" "}
            <IJS>children()</IJS> will be <IJS>null</IJS>.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a few possible ways to handle this situation. The first is
            to delay rendering by placing your <IJS>ReactDOM.render()</IJS> call
            inside of a <IJS>router.once()</IJS> callback. This will guarantee
            that the render isn't called until the first response is ready.
            Alternatively, you can update the render-invoked{" "}
            <IJS>children()</IJS> function to know what to do when{" "}
            <IJS>response</IJS> is <IJS>null</IJS>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Which approach is best will depend on the specifics of an
            application. If there are routes that will take a long time for the
            initial load, you will probably want to render something while they
            load. For async code with short loading times, a blank screen might
            be more acceptable.
          </p>
        </Explanation>
        <CodeBlock>
          {`const router = curi(...);
const Router = curiProvider(router);

// delay rendering
router.once(() => {
  ReactDOM.render((
    <Router>
      {...}
    </Router>
  ), holder);
});

// alternatively, render using null response
ReactDOM.render((
  <Router>
    {({ response }) => {
      if (response == null) {
        return <div>Loading...</div>;
      }
      const { body:Body } = response;
      return <Body response={response} />;
    }}
  </Router>
), holder);`}

      <Section title="Code Splitting" id="code-splitting">
        <Explanation>
          <p>
            Code splitting works by "dynamically" importing modules using the{" "}
            <IJS>import()</IJS> function. When bundlers like Webpack see{" "}
            <IJS>import()</IJS> functions, they know to create a separate bundle
            for that module (and that module's imports, etc.).
          </p>
          <p>
            You can add a <IJS>/* webpackChunkName: "chunkName" */</IJS> comment
            to an <IJS>import()</IJS> call to let Webpack know what to name a
            code split bundle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Create React App's default configuration is already setup to support
            code splitting, but if you were creating your own Webpack
            configuration, you would need to use{" "}
            <a href="https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/#output-chunkfilename">
              <IJS>output.chunkFilename</IJS>
            </a>{" "}
            to support code splitting.
          </p>
        </Explanation>
        <CodeBlock>
          {`// this creates a "Test" bundle
import(/* webpackChunkName: "Test" */ "./components/Test.js")`}
        </CodeBlock>

        <Explanation>
          <p>
            Currently, the <IJS>routes.js</IJS> module imports all of the route
            modules at the top of the file. In order to add code splitting, we
            need to switch to using <IJS>import()</IJS>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently <IJS>response()</IJS> returns an object whose{" "}
            <IJS>body</IJS> property is a module imported at the top of the
            file. Now we want to change this to have <IJS>body</IJS> be the
            imported module.
          </p>
        </Explanation>
        <CodeBlock>
          {`const routes = prepareRoutes([
  {
    name: "Test",
    path: "test",
    resolve: {
      body: () => import(/* webpackChunkName: "Test" */ "./components/Test.js")
    }
  }
]);`}
        </CodeBlock>

        <Note>
          <Explanation>
            <p>
              <IJS>import()</IJS> resolves a module object, not a component. Our
              components are exported using default exports, so they will be
              available as the module object's <IJS>default</IJS> property.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are a couple different approaches that you can take to
              accessing the component from the module object.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first is to use <IJS>import().then()</IJS> to resolve the
              module object's <IJS>default</IJS> property.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second is to reference <IJS>resolved.body.default</IJS> (or
              whatever you name the function) in the <IJS>response()</IJS>{" "}
              functions.
            </p>
            <p>Which you choose is mostly a matter of personal preference.</p>

        <Explanation>
          <p>
            When a module fails to load, the error will be passed to the{" "}
            <IJS>response()</IJS> function through the <IJS>error</IJS>{" "}
            property. We won't be incorporating this into the application here,
            but in a real application you probably want to have a fallback
            component to display an error message (especially if you have an
            offline mode with service workers).

        <Explanation>
          <p>
            We can now update the <IJS>routes.js</IJS> module to remove the
            imports at the top of the file and use <IJS>import()</IJS> to import
            the route components. We will use <IJS>then()</IJS> to only resolve
            the component instead of the entire module object.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <IJS>response()</IJS> functions should also be updated to set

        <Explanation>
          <p>
            Preloading data lets you delay navigation until after the data for a
            route has loaded. This can save you from having to render a partial
            page with spinners if the data takes a while to load.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the data is loading, the user will be able to continue
            interacting with the current page. This means that the user can also
            start a new navigation while the current navigation is running. When
            this happens, Curi knows to to cancel the previous navigation and
            perform the new navigation instead.

            We have two routes that need to load data: <IJS>Home</IJS> and{" "}

            books, while the <IJS>Book</IJS> route will load data about a
            specific book.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently the data for both of these routes is imported in their
            components. In a real site you would most likely make API calls to a
            REST or GraphQL endpoint, but here we will simulate this with a fake
            API.

              First, we will create an <IJS>api.js</IJS> module that exports the

              In the API module, we will import the <IJS>books.js</IJS> data.
            </p>
            <p>
              We need to write two functions. The first returns a list of all
              books and the second returns the data for a specific book. For
              both, we can use <IJS>Promise.resolve()</IJS> to return a Promise,
              even though we don't really have any asynchronous code being run.

            <IJS>routes.js</IJS> module so that we can call the functions from
            the routes' async methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            What do we want to do with the data loaded from the API calls? We
            can attach it to a response through its <IJS>data</IJS> property.
            When we render, we will be able to access that data as{" "}
            <IJS>response.data</IJS>. <IJS>data</IJS> can be anything you want
            it to be. We will set <IJS>data</IJS> to be an object with
            appropriately named properties.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <IJS>Home</IJS> route already has an <IJS>import()</IJS>, which
            we name <IJS>body</IJS>. We will name the async call to load the
            books data <IJS>"books"</IJS>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <IJS>Book</IJS> route's <IJS>response()</IJS> also needs to be
            updated to attach the books data (<IJS>resolved.books</IJS>) to the
            response.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <IJS>book()</IJS> API call expects to be given the <IJS>id</IJS>{" "}
            number of the book it should return data for. We can grab the
            correct param (<IJS>id</IJS>) from the <IJS>params</IJS> property.
            However, when params are parsed, they are stored as strings. To
            convert it to a number, we can use the route's <IJS>params</IJS>{" "}
            property to tell Curi how to parse the <IJS>id</IJS>. By giving it a
            function that calls <IJS>parseInt()</IJS> on the provided value,{" "}
            <IJS>params.id</IJS> will be a number instead of a string.

          <p>
            At this point, we have the same functionality as the basic tutorial,
            but we have added async data loading. The bundle importing has real
            loading times, but the fake API calls resolve immediately, which
            doesn't necessarily reflect real world performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can update the fake API to delay resolving so that we can take a
            look at some of the <IJS>@curi/react-dom</IJS> components that are
            navigation-aware. The implementation here isn't important, so you
            can just copy+paste the code. The only thing to know is that the{" "}
            <IJS>BOOKS()</IJS> function has a one second delay and the{" "}
            <IJS>BOOK()</IJS> function has a 2.5 second delay the first time a
            book is requested (and responds instantly on subsequent calls).

              The <Cmp>Link</Cmp> component can be called with a render-invoked{" "}

              be called with a <IJS>navigating</IJS> boolean that indicates
              whether the router is currently navigating to that link. This is
              useful for when you know that there is a long (multiple seconds)
              delay between when the user clicks the link and when the
              navigation will occur.

      <Section title="Async Caveats" id="caveats">
        <Explanation>
          <p>
            Adding asynchronous loading to an application can help reduce
            initial load size and speed up user interactions, however it also
            has some issues that you will need to consider.
          </p>
          <p>
            The biggest consideration is that there is nothing the frontend can
            do to get the data for the initial render faster. Your application's
            frontend can only fetch data as it discovers it needs it. If you are
            performing server-side rendering, you may want to load the initial
            data on the server and inject it into the page's HTML output. The
            implementation details for this vary greatly and are more related to
            how you store data (e.g.{" "}
            <a href="https://redux.js.org/recipes/server-rendering#the-server-side">
              with redux
            </a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            Another consideration is whether or not you want to "hoist" data
            requirements. Curi's async functionality relies on you knowing all
            of the data requirements for a route, but you might prefer to keep
            the data associated with individual components. React Suspense will
            help with this (and Curi will support it once it releases), but this
            is still a ways out. At the very least, I would recommend using Curi
            for code splitting routes. Whether your should hoist other data
            requirements is something that should be determined on a
            case-by-case basis.
