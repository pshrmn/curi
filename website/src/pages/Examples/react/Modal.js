          This example mimics the way that Pinterest works. Whether or not this
          is a good design pattern is up for debate, but at the very least it is
          helpful to see one way that you can do this with Curi.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are unfamiliar with the Pinterest model, this is how it works:
          When you navigate to a "modal route" from within the application, the
          route will open in a modal window (preserving the background content
          from the page that the user navigated from). If you load the same
          location manually, it will render the location in a full window.
        </p>

        <p>
          You will have to take a number of things into consideration when
          implementing this:
        </p>

        <p>
          The first is how to know whether to render a modal window or a full
          page. The easiest way to do his is to use <IJS>location.state</IJS> to
          attach a value to the location that indicates that you want to render
          a modal. State is persistent across refreshes and the user clicking
          the browser's forward/back buttons, so you will also have to take that
          into consideration.
        </p>

        <p>
          Second, <IJS>navigation.previous</IJS> is used to render the base
          layer displayed under the modal.
