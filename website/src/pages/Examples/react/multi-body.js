        <Explanation>
          <p>
            The <IJS>body</IJS> property of a response doesn't have to be a
            single component/function; the <IJS>body</IJS> can be anything you
            want it to be.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, you might want to provide the main and menu content for
            a route.
          </p>
        </Explanation>
        <CodeBlock lang="javascript">
          {`response() {
  return {
    body: {
      main: MainComponent,
      menu: MenuComponent
    }
  };
}`}
        </CodeBlock>

        <Explanation>
          <p>
            Another use case is when you have multiple routes that may share the
            same root component, but may have different nested components. If
            the root has state that you want preserved when navigating,
            rendering a common root component means that React will re-use the
            existing component.
          </p>
        </Explanation>

        <CodeBlock lang="javascript">
          {`response() {
  return {
    body: {
      // multiple routes may use this root
      root: StatefulComponent,
      content: MainComponent
    }
  };
}`}
        </CodeBlock>

        <Explanation>
          <Note>
            One thing to remember when attaching multiple components to a route
            is that all of your routes should have the same structure.
            Otherwise, when you render you will have to adapt your code to deal
            with different <IJS>response.body</IJS> layouts.
          </Note>
        </Explanation>

        <CodeBlock lang="javascript">
          {`// be consistent, don't use
// different body types
const routes = prepareRoutes([
  {
    ...,
    response() {
      return {
        body: OneLayout
      };
    }
  },
  {
    ...,
    response() {
      return {
        body: { another: Layout }
      };
    }
  }
]);`}
