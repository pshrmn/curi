      <Explanation>
        <p>
          Route interactions let you interact with a registered route using its
          name.
        </p>
        <p>
          A registered route is generally any route that is in the array of
          routes that you used to create your router. However, some interactions
          only register routes that meet some criteria. For example, the{" "}
          <IJS>prefetch</IJS> interaction only registers routes with
          asynchronous methods.
        </p>

        <p>
          Route interactions are defined using objects with four properties:
          name, register, get, and reset.
        </p>
      </Explanation>
      <CodeBlock>
        {`{
  // The string you will use to call the interaction.
  name: 'my',

  // A function used internally to register routes
  // with the interaction. You only need to use this when
  // writing your own interactions.
  register: function(route, parentData) {...},

  // This is the function that you will call. For example,
  // with this interaction, the get function will be
  // called when you call router.route.my('...')
  get: function(route) {...},
  reset: function() {...}
}`}
      </CodeBlock>

      <Explanation>
        <p>
          Instead of importing the actual route interaction object, you
          typically import a factory function to create the object. This isn't
          absolutely necessary, but is useful for server-side rendering.
        </p>
      </Explanation>
      <CodeBlock>
        {`// interactions/my.js
export default function createMyInteraction() {
  return {
    name: "my",
    register() {...},
    get() {...},
    reset() {...}
  };
}

// index.js
import createMyInteraction from "./interactions/my";

const interaction = createMyInteraction();`}

        <Explanation>
          <p>
            Route interactions are provided to the router call as an array using
            the <IJS>route</IJS> property of the options object (the third
            argument).
          </p>
        </Explanation>
        <CodeBlock>
          {`const router = curi(history, routes, {
  route: [createMyInteraction()]
});`}
        </CodeBlock>

        <Explanation>
          <p>
            The route interaction will be added to the router's <IJS>route</IJS>{" "}
            property. When you call an interaction, you pass the name of the
            route that you want to interact with.
          </p>

      <Section title="Creating Route Interactions" id="creating">
        <Explanation>
          <p>There are a few steps to creating your own route interactions.</p>

          <p>
            Remember to export a function that will create the interaction
            object, not the actual interaction object.
          </p>
        </Explanation>
        <CodeBlock>
          {`// we'll create an interaction that confirms
// a route is registered
export default function confirmInteraction() {
  ...
}`}
        </CodeBlock>

        <Explanation>
          <p>
            The function should return an object with four properties:{" "}
            <IJS>name</IJS>, <IJS>register</IJS>, <IJS>get</IJS>, and{" "}
            <IJS>reset</IJS>.

                  a function that will receive a route's name (and possibly
                  other arguments) and perform some task using the related route

                  a function that will reset the interaction's internal state
                  (this is used if you call <IJS>router.replaceRoutes()</IJS>)

        <Explanation>
          <p>
            In your application, you can import it, call the factory to create
            the interaction, and register the interaction when you create the
            router.
          </p>

        <CodeBlock>
          {`import { curi, prepareRoutes } from '@curi/router';
import confirmFactory from './interactions/confirm'

const routes = prepareRoutes([{ name: 'Home', path: '' }]);

const router = curi(history, routes, {
  route: [confirmFactory()]
});

router.route.confirm('Home'); // true
router.route.confirm('Elsewhere'); // false`}

        >
          <Explanation>
            <p>
              You might want to write an interaction that uses data from parent
              routes when registering a route. For example, the built-in
              pathname interaction joins a route's path with it parent path(s).
            </p>

            <p>
              The second argument passed to a router interaction's{" "}
              <IJS>register()</IJS> function is a parent data object. For root
              routes, this will be <IJS>undefined</IJS>. For nested routes, this
              is the value returned by the parent route's <IJS>register()</IJS>{" "}
              function.
            </p>

            {`function ParentFactory() {
  let routeTree = {};
  return {
    name: 'routeParent',
    register: (route, parent) => {
      routeTree[route.name] = parent;
      // we return route.name and any child routes will
      // receive that as their parent value
      return route.name;
    },
    get: (name) => {
      return routeTree[name];
    },
    reset: () => {
      routeTree = {};
    }
