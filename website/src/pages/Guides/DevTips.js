              Hot module replacement (HMR) can make development more convenient
              by automatically updating page content without refreshing the
              page. With Webpack, there are only a few steps required to get
              this working with Curi.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first step is to get your Webpack configuration setup for hot
              module replacement. Webpack's{" "}
              <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/hot-module-replacement/">
                hot module replacement guide
              </a>{" "}
              is a good resource to learn how to do this.

              The next step is identifying what file(s) you want to watch. A
              watched file will be notified when it, any of its dependencies, or
              any dependencies depndencies (and so on down the line) are
              updated. The best way to do this with a Curi application is to
              watch the file where your routes are defined.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <IJS>router</IJS> has a <IJS>refresh()</IJS> method that is
              used for providing new routes to the router. When it is called, it
              will also generate and emit a new response.
            </p>
            <p>
              <IJS>module.hot.accept()</IJS> is used for watching a file and
              calling a callback when that files or any files in its dependency
              chain are updated. In the callback, we can re-import the routes
              and pass them to the router's <IJS>refresh()</IJS> method. This
              will in turn emit a new response, which will automatically be
              rendered.
            </p>
            <p>
              With that, your application should be setup to support hot module
              replacement.
