      <Explanation>
        <p>
          It is important to keep in mind that some visitors to your site rely
          on screen readers, so you should ensure that they have a pleasant
          experience. One "issue" with single-page applications is that they
          traditionally are more difficult for screen reader users because they
          do not have a great way for detecting navigation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Curi provides a couple approaches to help you make your site
          accessible.
        </p>
      </Explanation>

      <Section title="Announcing Navigation" id="aria-live">
        <Explanation>
          <p>
            When the content of{" "}
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions">
              ARIA live regions
            </a>{" "}
            change, the new content will be announced to screen reader users.
            The{" "}
            <Link name="Package" params={{ package: "side-effect-aria-live" }}>
              <IJS>@curi/side-effect-aria-live</IJS>
            </Link>{" "}
            package provides a side effect for creating a live region and
            updating its content to announce navigation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The side effect takes a function which returns a string that should
            be read by screen readers. This can be whatever you want it to be,
            but screen readers normally read a page's title, so if you are
            setting <IJS>title</IJS>s for your responses, it is probably a good
            idea to have those announced.
          </p>
        </Explanation>
        <CodeBlock>
          {`import ariaLive from "@curi/side-effect-aria-live";
  
const announcer = ariaLive(
  ({ response }) => \`Navigated to \${response.title}\`
);

const routes = prepareRoutes([
  {
    name: "Home",
    path: "",
    response() {
      return {
        title: "Home"
      };
    }
  }
]);

const router = curi(history, routes, {
  sideEffects: [announcer]
});

// when the user navigates to "/", the screen reader
// will read: "Navigated to Home"`}

      <Section title="Focusing Content" id="focus">
        <Explanation>
          <p>
            Screen readers read the content of elements in the page that are
            focused. They can move through the page to read different elements.
            When you navigate, the content of the site will be re-rendered, so
            it is important for you to focus on the new content so that users
            using screen readers don't have to tab around looking for the new
            content. This is focus management and there are a couple things to
            keep in mind when implementing it.
          </p>
        </Explanation>

        <Explanation>
          <p>
            When you focus an element, make sure to focus the specific content
            for a page. If you were to just focus the page's <Cmp>body</Cmp> or
            a root <Cmp>div</Cmp>, then the user might have to tab through less
            important content, like the page's menus, while looking for the new
            content.
          </p>
        </Explanation>
        <CodeBlock lang="html">
          {`<!--
  it is better to focus the important content (<main>)
  and not the entire page
-->
<div>
  <header></header>
  <main></main>
</div>`}
        </CodeBlock>

        <Explanation>
          <p>
            The element that you focus needs to be focusable. Elements can be
            natively focusable (e.g. <Cmp>input</Cmp>s and <Cmp>a</Cmp>s) or you
            can use the <IJS>tabIndex</IJS> property. A <IJS>tabIndex</IJS> of{" "}
            <IJS>-1</IJS> lets you focus an element, but keeps screen readers
            from accidentally focusing it when a user is tabbing through the
            page's contents.
          </p>
          <Warning>
            If you try to focus an element that is not focusable, then the
            document's <Cmp>body</Cmp> will be focused instead.
          </Warning>
        </Explanation>
        <CodeBlock lang="html">
          {`<!-- you can focus us -->
<input />
<a href="https://example.com">Example</a>
<div tabIndex="-1"></div>

<!-- but not me -->
<div></div>`}

          <Explanation>
            <p>
              The <IJS>@curi/react-dom</IJS> package provides a <Cmp>Focus</Cmp>{" "}
              component that gives you a <IJS>ref</IJS> to attach to the
              component that should be focused. Whenever the user navigates, it
              will re-focus so that the screen reader is focused on the correct
              content.
            </p>
          </Explanation>
          <CodeBlock lang="jsx">

          <Explanation>
            <p>
              The <IJS>@curi/vue</IJS> package provides a directive for focusing
              an element. The directive needs to be passed something that
              changes when the user navigates, so you can just pass it the
              current <IJS>response</IJS>
            </p>
