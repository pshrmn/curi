        <p>
          React Router v4 isn't like most other routers because it lacks a
          centralized configuration. Migrating to Curi mostly involves
          re-centralizing your routes to simplify route management.

              With React Router v4, <Cmp>Route</Cmp>s are defined in components.
              They are usually grouped together under a <Cmp>Switch</Cmp> so
              that only a single route from a group renders. Nested routes are
              rendered inside of the compnent rendered by the parent{" "}

            <p>
              Routes in Curi are JavaScript objects. They are grouped together
              in an array of "top-level" routes. Nested routes are grouped under
              their parent route's <IJS>children</IJS> property.
            </p>

            <p>First, we will define the names and paths for our routes.</p>
            <p>
              Each route must have a unique name. A route's name will be used
              for interacting with it. For example, to navigate to a route, you
              only have to know its name, not its URL.
            </p>
            <p>
              The biggest difference between the Curi paths and the React Router
              paths is that with Curi, you never include a forward slash at the
              beginning of the path. This means that while the root path for
              React Router is <IJS>'/'</IJS>, the root path for Curi is{" "}
              <IJS>''</IJS>.

            <p>Next, we should add our components to each route.</p>
            <p>
              Curi routes can have a <IJS>response()</IJS> property, which is a
              function that returns an object of properties to merge onto the
              response that we will be using to render. For this React
              application, we want a response's <IJS>body</IJS> property to be
              the React component associated with each route.

              With React Router v4, a component's lifecycle methods are used for
              loading data, code splitting, and other non-rendering tasks. With
              Curi, routes can have functions that are called when they match
              the new location. These are grouped under the route's{" "}
              <IJS>resolve</IJS> object. The <IJS>resolve</IJS> functions are
              called every time that a route matches a location.

            With Curi, the router is created prior to rendering. It takes a

            object. <a href="https://github.com/pshrmn/hickory">Hickory</a> is
            similar to the <IJS>history</IJS> package used by React Router, but
            has a slight modified API (easier navigation blocking and navigation
            that imitates how anchors work) and more convenient location objects
            (you can use a <IJS>query</IJS> object instead of having to manually
            create a <IJS>search</IJS> string).

            We will walk through the rendering differences between React Router
            and Curi by looking at what happens in each when we navigate to the
            URL with the pathname <IJS>/inbox/test-message-please-ignore</IJS>.

          <Explanation>
            <p>
              React Router matches routes while it renders. It uses the{" "}
              <Cmp>Router</Cmp> component to listen for location changes. Each
              time that the location changes, the application re-renders.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <Cmp>Switch</Cmp> will iterate over its children{" "}
              <Cmp>Route</Cmp>s. The first route, <IJS>"/"</IJS> has an{" "}
              <IJS>exact</IJS> prop, so it only matches when the pathname is{" "}
              <IJS>"/"</IJS>. Since it is not, the next <Cmp>Route</Cmp> will be
              checked. The next route, <IJS>"/inbox"</IJS> matches the beginning
              of the pathname <IJS>"/inbox/test-message-please-ignore"</IJS>. It
              is not an exact match, but that route does not do exact matching,
              so React Router will render its component, <Cmp>Inbox</Cmp>.
            </p>

            <p>
              The <Cmp>Inbox</Cmp> has its own <Cmp>Switch</Cmp> to iterate
              over. Its first route only matches <IJS>"/inbox"</IJS> exactly, so
              it moves on to the next route, which has a <IJS>message</IJS>{" "}

          <Explanation>
            <p>
              With Curi, we also need to re-render our application every time
              that the location changes. We will do this by creating a root Curi
              component by calling the <IJS>curiProvider()</IJS> function, which
              comes from the <IJS>@curi/react-dom</IJS> package, and passing it
              our Curi router. While the name of this component is entirely up
              to you, we will refer to it as the <Cmp>Router</Cmp> here.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <Cmp>Router</Cmp> will setup an observer on the provided
              router so that it can re-render your application whenever there is
              a new <IJS>response</IJS>. The <Cmp>Router</Cmp> expects a
              function as its <IJS>children</IJS> prop (a render-invoked
              function). This function renders the application using the{" "}
              <IJS>response</IJS>.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the <Cmp>Router</Cmp>'s <IJS>children()</IJS> function is
              called, it will receive an object with three properties:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <IJS>response</IJS> is the new response object
              </li>
              <li>
                <IJS>navigation</IJS> is an object with additional information
                about the navigation
              </li>
              <li>
                <IJS>router</IJS> is your Curi router (mostly useful if the
                function is defined in a separate file)
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Above, we added <IJS>response()</IJS> functions to each route. The
              functions set React components as the <IJS>body</IJS> property of
              responses. We can now use <IJS>response.body</IJS> to render those
              components.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the React Router section, we had three components that were
              rendered: <Cmp>App</Cmp>,
              <Cmp>Inbox</Cmp>, and <Cmp>Message</Cmp>. With Curi, only the most
              accurately matched route actually matches. That means that for the
              URL <IJS>/inbox/test-message-please-ignore</IJS>, the{" "}
              <IJS>"Message"</IJS> route will match, but its parent route,{" "}
              <IJS>"Inbox"</IJS> will not, so <IJS>response.body</IJS> will be
              the <Cmp>Message</Cmp> component. Unlike React Router, we don’t
              render <Cmp>Inbox</Cmp> because we did not match the{" "}
              <IJS>inbox</IJS> route.

              <p>
                With React Router, any additional location properties are passed
                to the <Cmp>Link</Cmp> using the <IJS>to</IJS> object. With
                Curi, these properties are passed using the prop name (<IJS>
                  hash
                </IJS>, <IJS>query</IJS> &amp;
                <IJS>state</IJS>).

            <Explanation>
              <p>
                Active detection with Curi uses an <Cmp>Active</Cmp> component.{" "}
                <Cmp>Active</Cmp>'s <IJS>children</IJS> prop is a render-invoked
                function that receives a boolean <IJS>true</IJS> when the named
                route is active and <IJS>false</IJS> when it is not. You can
                also pass <IJS>{`partial=\{true\}`}</IJS> to partial matches
                (ancestor routes) be considered active (the opposite of React
                Router's <IJS>onlyActiveOnIndex</IJS>).

        <Explanation>
          <p>
            React Router provides a <IJS>withRouter</IJS> higher-order component
            that will inject router props into the wrapped component.
          </p>
          <p>
            Curi provides similar functionality with the <IJS>Curious</IJS>{" "}
            component.
          </p>
          <p>
            <IJS>Curious</IJS> has a render-invoked <IJS>children</IJS>{" "}
            function, which you can use to inject the Curi <IJS>router</IJS>,
            the current <IJS>response</IJS>, and the current{" "}
            <IJS>navigation</IJS> object into components.
          </p>
        </Explanation>
        <CodeBlock>
          {`// React Router
export default withRouter(SomeComponent);

// Curi
export default () => (
  <Curious>
    {({ response }) => (
      <SomeComponent response={response} />
    )}
  </Curious>
);`}

      <p>
        At this point, hopefully you are comfortable with migrating from React
        Router v4 to Curi. If there are any concepts not covered here that you
        think should be, please feel free to open up an issue{" "}
