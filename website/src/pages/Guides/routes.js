            The uniqueness of names is important so that you can interact with
            routes. The router's <IJS>route</IJS> method is used for getting
            data about a route using its name. Curi also has a concept of{" "}

              route interactions
            </Link>{" "}
            for working with this route data. For example, Curi provides a{" "}
            <IJS>pathname</IJS> route interaction to generate the pathname of a
            URL. This is particularly useful for routes with path params, since
            the <IJS>pathname</IJS> interaction will automatically insert these
            for you.

          When you create a router, you pass an array of all of the valid routes

          Route matching tests the route objects in the order that they are

            <Paragraph>
              Curi's default matching behavior is to match locations exactly.
              This means that when the route only matches part of the pathname,
              it does not consider that a match. Routes can be configured to
              allow partial matching, but exact matching is usually preferable.

            If the user navigates to a location with the pathname{" "}
            <IJS>"/a/red/yellow"</IJS>, the <IJS>Album</IJS> route will only
            partially match, so Curi will move on to the next route,{" "}
            <IJS>Not Found</IJS>. <IJS>Not Found</IJS> has a catch all{" "}
            <IJS>path</IJS> that matches every pathname, so it will match the

            the unmatched segments (<IJS>"/All+Night"</IJS>) will be checked
