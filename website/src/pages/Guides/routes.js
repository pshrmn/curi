      <Explanation>
        <p>
          Routes are JavaScript objects with two required properties—<IJS>
            name
          </IJS>{" "}
          and <IJS>path</IJS>—and a number of optional properties.
        </p>
        <p>
          A route's <IJS>path</IJS> is used to determine if a route matches a
          location. Path strings use{" "}
          <a href="https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp">
            <IJS>path-to-regexp</IJS>
          </a>{" "}
          formatting, which allows you to define dynamic path parameters that a
          route should match.
        </p>
        <p>
          A route's <IJS>name</IJS> is a unique identifier for a route. The{" "}
          <IJS>name</IJS> is used to{" "}
          <Link name="Guide" params={{ slug: "route-interactions" }}>
            interact
          </Link>{" "}
          with a specific route.
        </p>
        <Note>
          <IJS>path</IJS> strings do not start with a slash.

        <Explanation>
          <p>
            Why do routes have names? Curi lets you interact with routes using
            their names.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, Curi provides a <IJS>pathname</IJS> route interaction
            to generate the <IJS>pathname</IJS> of a location to navigate to.
            Instead of manually writing <IJS>pathname</IJS> strings, you tell
            Curi the name of the route that you want to navigate to (and also
            any required params) and Curi will create the <IJS>pathname</IJS>{" "}
            for you.

        <Explanation>
          <p>
            When a route matches, you might want to perform some actions before
            the application re-renders. This can include validating that a user
            is authorized to navigate to a route and loading data based on the
            path parameters parsed from the location.
          </p>
          <p>
            A route's <IJS>resolve</IJS> property is an optional object for
            attaching functions to a route. A response will not be emitted until
            after all of a route's <IJS>resolve</IJS> functions have finished.

          <p>
            A route with <IJS>resolve</IJS> properties is asynchronous, which

        <Explanation>
          <p>
            Each route can have a <IJS>response()</IJS> function, which returns
            an object of properties to merge with route's "match" properties.
            This combined object is a{" "}

            Only valid response properties will be merged onto the response.
            These are the optional response properties listed above (<IJS>

          <p>
            The function receives an object with a number of properties you

            Whenever Curi receives a new location, it will determine which route
            has a <IJS>path</IJS> that matches the new location's{" "}
            <IJS>pathname</IJS>. It does this by walking over the route objects
            in the order that they are defined in the array. If a route has{" "}

            <Warning>
              If none of your routes match a location, Curi will do nothing!
              Your routes should include catch all route to match these
              locations yourself. The best way to do this is to add a route to
              the end of your routes array with a <IJS>path</IJS> of{" "}

          <Explanation>
            <p>
              Curi's default matching behavior looks for exact matches. This
              means that when the route only matches part of the pathname, it
              does not count as a match. Routes can be configured to allow
              partial matching, but exact matching is usually preferable.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the user navigates to a location with the pathname{" "}
              <IJS>"/a/red/yellow"</IJS>, the <IJS>Album</IJS> route will only
              partially match, so Curi will move on to the next route,{" "}
              <IJS>Not Found</IJS>. <IJS>Not Found</IJS> has a catch all{" "}
              <IJS>path</IJS> that matches every pathname, so it will match the
              location.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a route has children, Curi will check if any of those routes
              form a complete match before moving on to the next route in the
              routes array.
            </p>

            {`// when the pathname is '/a/Coloring+Book/All+Night',
// the Album route will partially match the pathname.
// Then, its child route Song will be tested and fully

{
  name: 'Album',

    {
